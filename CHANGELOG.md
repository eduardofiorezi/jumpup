### Release Notes

* Version 0.3.0 - Remove old svn support. Add support for Simplecov on Ruby 1.9.
* Version 0.2.4 - Added support for git and git-svn. Thanks to [Sylvestre Mergulhão][sm] and [Eduardo Fiorezi][edu].
* Version 0.2.3 - BUG FIX: Rake db:migrate fails when default RAILS\_ENV is used. Thanks to Celestino Gomes for fix this bug.
* Version 0.2.2 - Removed vendor/plugins/* commit. This commit is necessary when use plugins with externals but it is not a good practice. Piston is the correct way to use externals plugins. If you want to use externals commit in your integration process you can create a svn:commit:after task.
* Version 0.2.1 - BUG FIX: Setting 'RAILS\_ENV' wasn't affecting migrations. This bug fix changes this behavior and makes sure that 'RAILS_ENV' set by the user will always be respected, for all tasks. Thanks to Sylvestre Mergulhão for point this out.
* Version 0.2   - Added support for SKIP\_COMMIT\_MESSAGES'.
